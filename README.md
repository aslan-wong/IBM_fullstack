Title: IBM Full-Stack Cloud Developer Projects

Description:

This repository houses the projects I completed while pursuing the IBM Full-Stack Cloud Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera. It serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills in full-stack development and cloud-native application creation using the following technologies and frameworks:

    Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like React and Bootstrap)
    Back-End Development: Node.js, Express.js (or similar frameworks)
    Cloud Platforms: Experience with multiple cloud platforms including Cloud Foundry, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud
    Version Control: Git (demonstrated through this GitHub repository)
    Additional Technologies: Databases (NoSQL databases and Django ORM), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift), CI/CD tools, Artificial Intelligence (AI) fundamentals, DevOps principles, microservices, and serverless computing

Project Structure:

    Each project will have its own dedicated folder within this repository.
    The folder structure within each project directory should be clear and consistent, following best practices (e.g., src for source code, assets for static files, etc.).
    Consider including a README.md file within each project folder to provide specific details and instructions.
